            <div class="col">
                <p class="text-justify">The greatest contribution you can make to your swimmer’s progress is to be a loving, supportive parent. First of all, a parent’s role is to supply encouragement, mental and moral support. Parents are welcome at practice. The coaches’ attention needs to be focused on the swimmers during practice. The coach’s job is to motivate and constructively criticize the swimmer’s performance. It is the parent’s job to supply the love, recognition, and encouragement necessary to make the child work harder in practice, which in turn gives him/her the confidence to perform well in competition. Each of our coaches has a different style of coaching. Some coaches are loud and some are quiet. No matter their style, they are seeking to motivate your swimmer to reach for their full potential. Please make every effort to have your swimmers at practice on time. Realize that your child is working hard and give all the support you can. Encourage good diet and sleeping habits. They will serve your children well.</p>

                <h4>Your Athlete</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <p class="text-justify">To have a successful program there must be understanding and cooperation among parents, swimmers, and coaches. The progress your child makes depends to a great extent on this triangular relationship. The following guidelines will help you keep your child’s development as an athlete in the proper perspective and help your child reach his/her full potential under the coach's direction. Ten and Under: Ten and under are the most inconsistent swimmers and this can be frustrating for parents, coaches and the swimmer alike! Parents and coaches must be patient and permit these youngsters to learn to love the sport. When a young swimmer first joins, there may be a brief period in which he/she appears to slow down. This is a result of the added concentration on stroke technique, but this will soon lead to much faster swims for the individual. Even the very best swimmer will have meets where they do not do their best times. These “plateaus” are a normal part of swimming. Over the course of a season, times should improve. Please be supportive of these “poor” meets. The older swimmers may have only two or three meets a year for which they will be rested and tapered. Sportsmanlike behavior and improved performance are of equal importance. All the coaches teach swimmers how to behave like champions whether the swimmers have a “good” or a “bad” swim. Respect for officials, congratulations to other competitors, encouragement to teammates, determined effort, and mature attitudes are examples of great behavior. A swimmer should be praised for improving his/her stroke or time. It is the coach’s job to offer constructive criticism of a swimmer’s performance. It is the parent’s responsibility to provide love and encouragement that bolster the swimmer’s confidence along the way. Swimmers are taught to set realistic, yet challenging goals for meets and to relate those goals to practice to direct their training efforts. Swimmers are prepared and encouraged to compete in all swimming events, distances, and strokes. This promotes versatility and encourages the swimmer to explore his potential in the wide range of events offered in competitive swimming. Often times, a swimmer’s “best” stroke changes as they mature and his/her body goes through physical changes.</p>
